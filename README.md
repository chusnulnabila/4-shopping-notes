## ðŸ›’ Shopping Notes
**Shopping Notes** is a simple project to practice **React.js**. This website was created by following a **[React tutorial by Web Programming UNPAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX2kAHnCEjY&list=PLFIM0718LjIUu3X2zYNqomEWs3sYd-fV1&index=4)**, marking my first steps in building applications with React.

Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ve learned a lot about React basics, but I also realized the importance of consistent practice to truly master the concepts.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
